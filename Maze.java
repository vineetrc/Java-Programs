	 * @param col, current column index of the char

	 * 
	 * Program Description : 
	 * the program checks if any side positions are ' ' and are "solved"
	 * remember these all are if statements and more than one of them can run and return values being at the same index.
	 * if we had done return solve(row, col + 1) , the program would exit without checking other
	 * possibilities. (infinite recursion/ stack overflow are other possibilities). The problem
	 * is not with the single path, the problem arises when we have MULTIPLE path to go from a point and only one
	 * of those path works.
	 * how this algorithm handles this problem is it will wait to see if those path are really valid at junctions.
	 * it fills the position that row,col were pointing right before with '.' (can be any other characters except ' ', the advantage is it will prevent infinite
	 * recursion. Infinite recursion occurs when function(a,b) and function(c,d) keep calling each other infinitely because the condition is always true)
	 * if one path is not valid , solved = false; will return but the other "trees" will still be exploring the path.
	 * this process continues until we reach 'G'.
